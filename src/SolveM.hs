-- Stack explanation:
--   Writer -> Log = [Doc ann]
--   Reader -> Source 'Equation' AST
--   State  -> Current Equation
--   Except -> Throw execution error

-- TODO: Possible idea:
-- newtype SolveM c a
--   where `c` is the current candidate, and provide traversal functions, such that you can switch from candidate
--   e.g. Equation -> EquationL
--   this allows for more flexibility with creating tactics and cleaner code.
--   Possibly makes this entire thing extensible to ComputorV2
